# Finite-Node-List-in-C

This repository contains a List structure that contains a finite number of nodes and list heads that I created for a class.  Each head is used to define a list, and the pool of nodes is shared between all active lists.  No memory is dynamically allocated.

## List.h

Contains all function prototypes with appropriate definitions.  Also contains the declarations of the maximum number of nodes (default: 100) and the maximum number of node heads (default: 10).  Users are encouraged to change this to suit their needs.  

## List.c

Contains all function definitions.

## test.c

Script that tests the functionality of the list.
